## WEEK 1:
###### Orientation
* I was introduced to **Discrete Mathematics**, a challenging yet interesting subject.
* I have understood the difference of DISMATH from other branches of Mathematics.
* Because of the logic problems about knights and knaves, I was able to have a sort of "preview" of what I will learn from this course.

###### Basic terms in DISMATH
* Proposition
* Logical deduction
* Axiom
* Mathematical proof

The examples given in class helped me to distinguish which statements are propositions and which are not.
The kinds of TRUTH depending on its beholder were also enumerated.
* Legal truth
* Authoritative truth
* Scientific truth
* Probable truth 
* Philosophical truth

###### Logical Connectives
I was introduced to the concept of logical connectives, their symbols and their usage. The truth table for each logical connective were also shown and explained well. Again, the example propostions presented made it easier for me to understand the relationship of the input and output for each operator.
* Negation (¬) used as *NOT*
* Conjunction (˄) used as *AND*
* Disjunction (˅) used as *OR*
* Exclusive or (⊕) used as *XOR*
* Conditional (→) used as *IF, THEN*
* Biconditional (↔) used as *IF AND ONLY IF*

I also learned that when p → q:
* its converse q → p, and
* its inverse ¬p → ¬q are not equal to p → q
* its contrapositive ¬q → ¬p is equal to p → q

###### Logical Equivalences
* Identity laws
* Domination laws
* Idempotent laws
* Double negation law
* Commutative laws
* Associative laws
* Distributive laws
* De Morgan's laws
* Absorption laws
* Negation laws

At first, I had a hard time applying these laws in showing that two expressions are logically equivalent. Eventually, I understood it better by studying the proof of the laws.

## WEEK 2:
###### Predicate Logic
* I learned that not only sentences, but also propositions have a subject and a predicate.
* I understood the proper usage of quantifiers which are:
  * Existential quantifier (∃x) which means "there exists"
  * Universal quantifier (∀x) which means "for all"
* A *counterexample* is a disqualification from a universal claim.
* Real-life examples of existential and universal claims helped me to appreciate and understand the concept more.

###### Rules of Inference
This lesson was introduced to me by the defining some important terminologies.
* argument
* valid
* fallacy
* tautology

I realized that it is important to understand the concept and patterns of a valid argument in order apply the rules of inference correctly.
* Modus ponens
* Modus tollens
* Hypothetical syllogism
* Disjunctive syllogism
* Addition
* Simplification
* Conjunction
* Resolution

Both the Superman and the sunset problem helped me to understand logical equivalences and rules of inference. During class, I also realized that for some cases, it is better and easier to use truth tables for some problems.

## WEEK 3:
###### Methods of Proof
* Direct proof
 * Assume that p is true.
 * Show that q is also true.
* Proof by contraposition (indirect)
 * Assume that ¬q is true.
 * Show that ¬p is also true.
* Vacuous and Trivial proof
 * Vacuous proof: Show that p is false so p → q must be true.
 * Trivial proof: Show that q is true so p → q must be true.
* Proof by Contradiction
 * Assume that ¬p is true. (p refers to the whole statement)
 * Show that Step 1 ends up in a contradiction.

So far, I find the vacuous and trivial proof easiest to understand. I still get slightly confused with some problems involving the other kinds of proofs.

## WEEK 4:
###### Methods of Proof
* Proof of Equivalence
 * Show that p → q and q → p are both true to prove a biconditional statement.
* Counterexamples
 * We must find a counterexample x in which P(x) will be false to prove that an existential claim is false.
* Mathematical Induction
 * Basis Step: Verify P(1) is true.
 * Inductive Step: Show that P(x) → P(x+1) is true for all values of x.

## WEEK 5:
This week, we learned about the following:
* Recursive and Inductive definition
* Recursive algorithm
* Power series
* Program Correctness
* Hoare Triple

## WEEK 6:
* We were introduced to the lesson about sets and cardinality.
* We reviewed the lesson about quantifiers and nested quantifiers in preparation for our first quiz.

###### Functions
* A *function* f from A to B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A.
* Functions are also called *mappings/transformations*.
* Domain - set of real numbers
* Codomain - set of integers
* Range - actually occurring values
* Types of functions
 * One-to-one function (injective)
 * Onto function (subjective)
 * One-to-one and onto (bijective)
