## WEEK 1:
###### Orientation
* I was introduced to **Discrete Mathematics**, a challenging yet interesting subject.
* I have understood the difference of DISMATH from other branches of Mathematics.
* Because of the logic problems about knights and knaves, I was able to have a sort of "preview" of what I will learn from this course.

###### Basic terms in DISMATH
* Proposition
* Logical deduction
* Axiom
* Mathematical proof

The examples given in class helped me to distinguish which statements are propositions and which are not.
The kinds of TRUTH depending on its beholder were also enumerated.
* Legal truth
* Authoritative truth
* Scientific truth
* Probable truth 
* Philosophical truth

###### Logical Connectives
I was introduced to the concept of logical connectives, their symbols and their usage. The truth table for each logical connective were also shown and explained well. Again, the example propostions presented made it easier for me to understand the relationship of the input and output for each operator.
* Negation (¬) used as *NOT*
* Conjunction (˄) used as *AND*
* Disjunction (˅) used as *OR*
* Exclusive or (⊕) used as *XOR*
* Conditional (→) used as *IF, THEN*
* Biconditional (↔) used as *IF AND ONLY IF*

I also learned that when p → q:
* its converse q → p, and
* its inverse ¬p → ¬q are not equal to p → q
* its contrapositive ¬q → ¬p is equal to p → q

###### Logical Equivalences
* Identity laws
* Domination laws
* Idempotent laws
* Double negation law
* Commutative laws
* Associative laws
* Distributive laws
* De Morgan's laws
* Absorption laws
* Negation laws
At first, I had a hard time applying these laws in showing that two expressions are logically equivalent. Eventually, I understood it better by studying the proof of the laws.
