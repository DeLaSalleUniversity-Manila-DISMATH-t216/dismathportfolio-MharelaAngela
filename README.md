## WEEK 1:
###### Orientation
* I was introduced to **Discrete Mathematics**, a challenging yet interesting subject.
* I have understood the difference of DISMATH from other branches of Mathematics.
* Because of the logic problems about knights and knaves, I was able to have a sort of "preview" of what I will learn from this course.
